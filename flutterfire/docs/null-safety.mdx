title: Null Safety
---

Dart [sound null safety](https://dart.dev/null-safety) is currently in beta, however; some FlutterFire packages
have preview versions of null-safety implementations that are available to use.

The below table outlines the latest null-safe plugin versions:


|                 Plugin |                                  Version |
| ---------------------: | ---------------------------------------: |
|      `cloud_firestore` |      `^{{ plugins.cloud_firestore_ns }}` |
|        `firebase_auth` |        `^{{ plugins.firebase_auth_ns }}` |
|        `firebase_core` |        `^{{ plugins.firebase_core_ns }}` |
| `firebase_crashlytics` | `^{{ plugins.firebase_crashlytics_ns }}` |
|   `firebase_messaging` |   `^{{ plugins.firebase_messaging_ns }}` |
|      `cloud_functions` |      `^{{ plugins.cloud_functions_ns }}` |

### Using with other non-null-safe FlutterFire packages

:::caution
Mixing currently **published** null-safety FlutterFire packages alongside **published** non-nullsafety packages is not supported.
:::

Not all FlutterFire packages have null-safety versions available yet. If you need to use the null-safe packages alongside
the non-null-safe packages then it's recommended you switch to sourcing your FlutterFire packages directly from the [main
FlutterFire repository](https://github.com/FirebaseExtended/flutterfire) (rather than pub.dev) where the packages have
compatible version constraints.
